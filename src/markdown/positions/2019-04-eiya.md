#Role
As a **remote full time developer** I work along with the dev team for internal **Eiya** products under **SCRUM** framework. We have daily/bi-weekly meetings with the team. We use Google Docs + Asana + Miro for project management. We use **Slack** for team communication and **Git** (Gitlab) for version control (following **git flow** branching model).

#Projects

**Eiya** is a **shipping** company **committed to the environment** and **focused on e-commerce** clients. Eiya uses 2 products for internal operation: **Dispatch System and Messengers Mobile App**. There are 3 client products: **Client Dashboard**, **Shopify** integration and a a **Public API** for developers .

All of these projects are designed as services to communicate with each other internally and externally with end-users.

##Dispatching System

Internal operation product to **manage orders lifecycle** and **real-time**, **geolocalized route assignment** to messengers. I was in charge of the whole project since the beginning.

This project also includes a **RESTful API that allows Messengers App actions.**

<ul class="challenges">
  <li>Order lifecycle management required a <strong>finite state machine approach</strong>.</li>
  <li>Developed <strong>my own implementation of Organizer-Interactor pattern</strong> based on <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor">this RoR gem</a> to manage order state change.</li>
  <li>Frontend and mobile app are <strong>notified via push notifications</strong> and <strong>websocket</strong> messages respectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Scheduled tasks</strong> are required to generate reports.</li>
  <li><strong>UI performance</strong> was key to <strong>speed up order assignment</strong>, so I worked along with frontend developer to <strong>deliver the most performant experience to internal users</strong>.</li>
</ul>


###Backend
- Docker-compose for local development
- Postgresql for database
- Django + REST Framework for API
- Postman for API documentation
- Django-channels + Redis for realtime messaging
- Gunicorn + Uvicorn as ASGI server
- Celery + Celery-beat for scheduled tasks
- JWT based authentication
- PDF and Excel reporting
- Django-storages to manage static files over AWS S3
- Django-push-notifications to notify mobile app users
- Sendgrid for email delivery
- Google Maps API for reverse geolocation
- Sentry for exceptions capture
- Unittest and API Client (DRF) for testing
- Pytest for async testing (channels)
- Pylint + Autopep8 + Pre-commit for code quality

##Messengers App

**Multiplatform mobile app** to manage orders assigned to messengers. Worked along with another React developer.

<ul class="challenges">
  <li>This was my first experience with React Native and the <strong>first feature was ready in a couple of weeks for both platforms</strong>: Android and iOS.</li>
  <li><strong>Background geolocation</strong> was a key feature (and it's not well supported by react native), so after testing many public libraries without success I decided to developed our own native module to provide a <strong>non-stop background android service</strong> compatible with <strong>headless js</strong>.</li>
</ul>

###Mobile app

- React Native initially targeting both platforms (now only available for android)
- Followed Figma mockups
- Yarn for package management
- Axios for http requests
- Redux + redux-thunk + redux-offline for persistent state management
- Firebase for push notifications
- Custom non-stop background android service compatible with headless js
- React-native-navigations for screens navigation
- Sentry for exceptions capture
- Detox for e2e testing
- Eslint + husky + lint-staged for code quality
- Published to Play Store (still on beta channel)

This project also makes use of many **third-party libraries** to access native APIs such as **camera, location, maps, image and files providers, permissions**, among others.

##Public API

Public API **for developers** that allows them to schedule Pick up and Drop off orders to ship their products.

<ul class="challenges">
  <li>App needed a <strong>really good documentation</strong> built with Postman.</li>
  <li>App needed <strong>excellent performance</strong> to generate <strong>up to 50 tasks per request</strong>.</li>
  <li>App needed to be <strong>real-time connected</strong> to Dispatching System in order to <strong>speed up</strong> Messenger assignments.</li>
</ul>

I was in charge of the whole project since the beginning.

- Pylint + Autopep8 + Pre-commit for code quality

##Clients Dashboard

RESTful API for clients dashboard frontend that allows order management actions. Worked along with other backend developers.

###Backend
